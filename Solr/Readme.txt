Ninject and Ninject.Integration.SolrNet are referenced from a SharedAssembly folder, because we need a 'grouping' functionality that is available in 4.0 version of solr, that is currently in an Alpha, and is not ported to Nuget, I keep a nuget reference, because project uses clasess created by Nuget, please change reference to Nuget, as soon as version 4.0 will be released (currently 3.1).
